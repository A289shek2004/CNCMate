⭐ CNCMate: AI-Powered CNC Analytics Platform
Refined, Beginner-Friendly Project Report (as per professor's expectations)
1. Introduction

CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines are widely used in manufacturing. In India, millions of MSMEs depend on CNC machines for daily production. However, most small workshops face several problems:

They cannot see machine performance in real time

Machine breakdowns happen unexpectedly

Maintenance logs are manual and inaccurate

Defects are found late

Machine, operator, and job data is not digitized

Because of this, production gets delayed, costs increase, and decision-making is mostly guesswork.

To solve these challenges, CNCMate is proposed as a data-driven AI analytics platform that uses IoT-based data collection, data engineering, and machine learning to:

monitor machines in real time

predict failures before they occur

track jobs, operators, and defects

provide dashboards and reports

This project focuses mainly on the data science and machine learning parts, keeping the technical development simple and achievable.

2. Project Objectives (Simplified)

The main goals of CNCMate are:

Predict machine failures in advance using ML models

Analyze CNC machine performance through dashboards

Track tool life and estimate when tools need replacement

Perform defect analytics using collected data

Digitize CNC operations such as job details and operator logs

Generate automated reports for supervisors and owners

These objectives help MSMEs reduce downtime and improve productivity through data-driven insights.

3. Problems in the Industry (Simplified Table)
Problem	Why It Is a Problem
No real-time visibility	Owners don’t know what's happening inside the machine
Manual logging	Leads to mistakes and missing information
Unplanned breakdowns	Production stops suddenly & increases repair cost
Poor defect tracking	Quality control becomes weak
No predictive maintenance	Failures occur without warning
No OEE measurement	Cannot evaluate productivity

These problems make small factories inefficient and uncompetitive.

4. Proposed Solution – CNCMate (Simplified Overview)

CNCMate provides the following major features:

1. Live Monitoring (Basic IoT Simulation Used)

Machine status: ON/OFF/IDLE

Spindle speed

overheating

vibration-based failures

3. Tool Life Estimation
